# Analysis of LLMs along their depth
Jaisidh Singh

### Depth-wise representation similarity

- [ ] cosine similarity - only residual
- [ ] cosine similarity - random inputs
- [ ] cosine similarity - rand. init
- [ ] cosine similarity - de-correlated
- [ ] cosine similarity - factual data
- [ ] cosine similarity - gsm8k

### Depth-wise eigenspectrum analysis

- [ ] eigenspectrum difference - non-ln-scaling model
- [ ] eigenspectrum difference - ln-scaling model

### Depth-wise impacts

- [ ] influence on ntp - non-ln-scaling model
- [ ] influence on ntp - ln-scaling model
